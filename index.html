                  <p>My name is Patrick Abou Sleiman, and I am a fourth-year computer science international student at the university of Ottawa. <br>
                     Before coming to Ottawa, I volunteered with the Lebanese Red Cross – Youth Department for 5 years. While I was there, we did a lot of events and workshops with kids, everyone event would be around a certain humanitarian theme that would teach the kids a valuable lesson at the end. <br>
                     I was also working in an event planning company for kids’ birthday, so I was around all sort of kids wearing big fluffy costumes.

                  <p>After I came here, I started volunteering with uOttawa Supporting Red Cross Club – currently co-president, and with NetRoots – currently VP Tech. I am also volunteering with CMIC on campus as their webmaster and Special Olympics Ottawa, also as a webmaster.

                  <p>I was helping the kids brainstorming and translating their ideas into reality. This activity made me realise that this type of activities will challenge the kids to express themselves better, and challenged myself to be useful and offer help to kids. </p>

                  Ozobots are pocket-sized robots that will follow a line that you draw. It is programmed to interpret certain colour patterns to do tricks like turning around or pause his movement for some time. 
                  In my opinion, this was a nice way to waste some time during the day and give the chance for kids to play with robots. However, this activity did not make them explore and create. Yes, they were creating patterns for the robot to follow, but it didn’t have the same effect as other activities like scratch.
                  <br>
                  This activity did not require any intervntions from our part, so it was some free time for us to go around and watch kids, and take a small break.

                     Most of the time, it was very quiet and fun time for the kids, it was also an opportunity to stretch out and get them a bit exhausted after lunch. However, on the first PD Day, 2 kids got in a fight and one of them decided to chase the other with a stick around the park. So I was his shield at the end and pulled them apart.

                  <p>
                     When we came back, I noticed that none of the instructors addresses the issue and talked to them, so I took the initiative and talked to them in private. I let each one tells me their end of the story, and made them promise me not to make any troubles. They apologized to each other and went back inside, I was super proud of myself at that moment, until they started fighting again 10 mins later so we kept them away from each other the entire day.

                     When we went to the playground on PD Day 2, two girls brought books with them. They were sitting in the playground reading while the rest of the kids were playing, jumping around and screaming. So I went and negotiated with them to keep their books with me for 10 mins and then to go play. After a full minute of arguments, they accepted and came back later to keep reading

                     I know we are not supposed to have a favorite kid, but he is a very special kid! His name is Kaese, we met on the 2nd PD day. It all started when we went for scavenger hunt around campus, he would go around and just stick his fingers in every single hole he finds, so I end up carrying him the rest of the scavenger hunt. Since then, he stayed around me and asking me every time he needed help for the rest of the day. At the end of the PD Day, he gave me a big hug before leaving. <br>
                     He came back in November for the second PD day, he immediately ran and hugged me. It was a very sweet moment! And he kept hugging me throughout the day at random moments., I would just feel something around my leg and turn around to find him hugging me.

                     It all started with a simple idea: Let kids design a race car and laser cut it. Well, nothing went as planned. After teaching them about Inkspace, the kids started working on their own race car, after one hour of helping them, none of them would work well since the dimensions are off, so we end up laser cutting the same car for everyone. Next task was assembling the car, and to do so, they needed to use hot glue. I did not like the idea that kids play with hot glue, so I took the initiative to assemble it for them. It only took me around 3 hours to finish all 18 of them.
                  </p>
                  <p>At the end of the day, I went and spoke with Carolyne to give her my feedback since we are going to be doing the same activity again, and she ended up changing the activity for the last PD day. </p>

                     We made some other cool activities, like space landers, hoop gliders, scratch and Makey Makey. Some of them were more interesting and challenging, and they made me more involved in helping the kids. 
                     <br>On the last PD Day, I decided to actually do the space lander with the kids since we never have the chance to do it after. So I went and sat with kids and worked on my own space lander. Don’t want to brag or anything, but my space lander was the best – I know that I am not supposed to say that but it’s the truth… I ended up giving it to a kid who wanted it.
                  </p>
                  <p>This experience made me realize how smart these kids are, even if they failed. Those kids try to come up with a prototype from papers and popsicle sticks and they are supposed to make it work in one hour. After spending those 4 days with them, I realised that these kids are a lot smarter than I thought they would be.

                     Makermobile had a different setup than what I am used to in PD days, instead of meeting the kids on campus, we had to go to their school and give the workshop in their library. 
                     <br>I found what we did redundant and a bit boring at the end since we did the same workshop four different times and I had no role in the presentation – only helping kids when they raise their hands. 
                     <br>I spent most of the workshop sitting in the back and waiting until the instructor finishes his introduction about engineers and start giving them an overview of Scratch. 
                     <br>However, I took the initiative to ask for permission to take pictures from the teachers because there’s some kids who do not like their pics taken. So I spent my time taking pictures and pass time until someone needed me.

                     As a webmaster for Special Olympic Ottawa, I don’t have a lot of contact with the community and the athletes, that’s why it was a great opportunity for me to volunteer for these two events. <br>
                     It was also completely different from my previous experiences in this class because I did not have to deal with kids – I love kids but I reached a point where I needed a break from them and this is why I enjoyed volunteering for SOO. The bowlathon was the most challenging event because I was the photographer for the event and I ended up talking to everyone there to take permission and introduce myself. 
                  </p>
                  <p>The two events pushed me out of my shell, I usually tend to be a bit shy when there’s a big group of people – I am working on it and this was a great opportunity to practice in.

                  <p>  I always used to say that everything is worth it as long as at least one child went back home smiling.</p>
                  <p>I wish we were more involved before the day of the volunteering, or being assigned a task to do for the day, like giving a certain workshop or take a lead on one part of the schedule. </p>
                  <p>This class made me remember why I started volunteering, and sometimes made me realise why I stopped as well. </p>
                  <p>Yes, I want to volunteer more in the future, maybe not for events like PD days or MakerMobile. I would prefer something more humanitarian or that includes a good cause instead of just spending a day with kids who paid money to be there. </p>
                  <p>I learned throughout this experience that kids nowadays have a bigger opportunity to lean and explore new things that was not available in my time, and that we should encourage them to be curious and experiment new things. </p>
                  <p>Some kids made me speechless with some questions regarding coding, a ten years old boy asked me about my favorite language and then asked if inkspace was vector or pixel based software. Then proceeded to talk about tech stuff with his friends. This made me realise that I need to step up my game before they take my job in the future… </p>
